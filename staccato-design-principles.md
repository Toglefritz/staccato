# Staccato Design Principles

## Core Design Philosophy

The Staccto software should feel like a natural extension of family life - intuitive, helpful, and unobtrusive. Every design decision should prioritize family harmony and ease of use over technical complexity.

## User Experience Principles

### 1. Age-Inclusive Design
- **Visual Clarity**: Large, clear text and icons suitable for children and adults
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and colorblind-friendly palettes
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44pt touch targets for easy interaction
- **Simple Navigation**: Maximum 2-3 taps to reach any feature

### 2. Family-Centric Interface
- **Color Coding**: Each family member has a consistent color throughout the system
- **Personal Spaces**: Clear visual separation of individual vs. shared content
- **Inclusive Language**: Gender-neutral, age-appropriate terminology
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Flexible date/time formats and holiday support

### 3. Kiosk-Optimized Experience
- **Always-On Display**: Designed for continuous operation in landscape mode
- **Glanceable Information**: Key information visible from across the room
- **Minimal Interaction**: Most information should be visible without interaction
- **Auto-Return**: Return to home screen after period of inactivity

## Visual Design Standards

### Layout Principles
- **Grid-Based Layout**: Consistent 8pt grid system
- **Generous Spacing**: Minimum 16pt between interactive elements
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different iPad orientations and sizes
- **Safe Areas**: Respect device safe areas and avoid edge placement

## Interaction Design

### Touch Interactions
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual response within 100ms of touch
- **Clear States**: Distinct visual states for normal, pressed, disabled
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe for navigation, long-press for context menus
- **Accidental Touch Prevention**: Confirmation for destructive actions

### Animation Guidelines
```dart
class FamilyAnimations {
  static const Duration fast = Duration(milliseconds: 200);
  static const Duration medium = Duration(milliseconds: 300);
  static const Duration slow = Duration(milliseconds: 500);
  
  static const Curve easeInOut = Curves.easeInOut;
  static const Curve bounceIn = Curves.bounceIn;
}
```

### Navigation Patterns
- **Tab-Based Navigation**: Primary navigation via bottom tabs
- **Contextual Actions**: Secondary actions via floating action buttons
- **Breadcrumbs**: Clear path indication for nested screens
- **Back Navigation**: Consistent back button placement and behavior

## Content Strategy

### Information Hierarchy
1. **Critical Information**: Weather, urgent tasks, today's schedule
2. **Daily Information**: Regular tasks, upcoming events, family messages
3. **Contextual Information**: Photos, secondary tasks, settings access
4. **Background Information**: Completed tasks, past events, system status

### Content Freshness
- **Real-Time Updates**: Tasks, calendar events, weather
- **Scheduled Updates**: Photos rotation, weekly summaries
- **Manual Updates**: Family settings, member information
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Completed tasks, old events, cached data

## Accessibility Standards

### Profile-Specific Accessibility
- **Individual Settings**: Each family member profile maintains independent accessibility preferences
- **Automatic Adjustment**: Accessibility settings automatically apply when switching active profiles
- **Override Capability**: Profile settings can override system-level accessibility preferences
- **Inheritance Options**: Child profiles can inherit accessibility settings from parent profiles

### Visual Accessibility
- **Profile-Based Font Scaling**: Each member can have custom text scale factors independent of iOS system settings
- **Individual High Contrast**: Per-profile high-contrast mode with customizable contrast ratios
- **Personal Color Schemes**: Profile-specific color adjustments for colorblind accessibility
- **Custom Focus Indicators**: Adjustable focus indicator size and color per profile
- **Brightness Preferences**: Individual screen brightness preferences that apply during member sessions

```dart
class ProfileAccessibilitySettings {
  /// Custom text scale factor for this profile (0.8 to 2.0)
  /// Independent of system accessibility settings
  final double textScaleFactor;
  
  /// Whether high contrast mode is enabled for this profile
  final bool highContrastEnabled;
  
  /// Custom contrast ratio (1.0 to 4.5) when high contrast is enabled
  final double contrastRatio;
  
  /// Color adjustment settings for colorblind accessibility
  final ColorBlindnessType? colorBlindnessAdjustment;
  
  /// Custom focus indicator settings
  final FocusIndicatorSettings focusSettings;
  
  /// Preferred screen brightness (0.1 to 1.0)
  final double preferredBrightness;
  
  /// Whether to use larger touch targets for this profile
  final bool largeTouchTargets;
  
  /// Custom animation speed multiplier (0.5 to 2.0)
  final double animationSpeed;
}
```

### Motor Accessibility
- **Profile-Based Touch Targets**: Configurable touch target sizes per family member (44pt to 64pt)
- **Individual Gesture Preferences**: Per-profile gesture sensitivity and alternative input methods
- **Custom Timing Settings**: Adjustable interaction timeouts and hold durations per profile
- **Personal Navigation**: Profile-specific navigation preferences (swipe vs tap, etc.)
- **Adaptive Controls**: Touch target positioning based on individual motor capabilities

### Cognitive Accessibility
- **Simplified Interfaces**: Optional simplified UI mode per profile for cognitive accessibility
- **Custom Information Density**: Adjustable information complexity based on individual needs
- **Personal Reminders**: Profile-specific reminder frequency and notification styles
- **Reading Assistance**: Per-profile text-to-speech and reading support settings
- **Memory Aids**: Individual settings for progress indicators and step-by-step guidance

### Age-Appropriate Accessibility
- **Child-Friendly Settings**: Automatic accessibility adjustments for child profiles
- **Senior-Friendly Options**: Enhanced accessibility defaults for older family members
- **Learning Disabilities Support**: Specialized settings for dyslexia, ADHD, and other learning differences
- **Progressive Complexity**: Ability to gradually increase interface complexity as children grow

### Accessibility Profile Management

```dart
class AccessibilityProfileManager {
  /// Applies accessibility settings when switching to a family member
  Future<void> applyProfileAccessibility(String memberId) async {
    final settings = await getAccessibilitySettings(memberId);
    
    // Apply text scaling
    await _applyTextScaling(settings.textScaleFactor);
    
    // Apply contrast settings
    if (settings.highContrastEnabled) {
      await _applyHighContrast(settings.contrastRatio);
    }
    
    // Apply color adjustments
    if (settings.colorBlindnessAdjustment != null) {
      await _applyColorAdjustments(settings.colorBlindnessAdjustment!);
    }
    
    // Apply brightness preferences
    await _adjustScreenBrightness(settings.preferredBrightness);
    
    // Apply touch target sizing
    await _applyTouchTargetSizing(settings.largeTouchTargets);
    
    // Apply animation speed
    await _applyAnimationSpeed(settings.animationSpeed);
  }
  
  /// Reverts to default accessibility settings when no profile is active
  Future<void> revertToDefaultAccessibility() async {
    // Restore system-level accessibility settings
  }
  
  /// Inherits accessibility settings from parent profile for child members
  Future<AccessibilitySettings> inheritFromParent(String childId, String parentId) async {
    final parentSettings = await getAccessibilitySettings(parentId);
    return parentSettings.copyWith(
      // Apply age-appropriate modifications
      textScaleFactor: math.max(parentSettings.textScaleFactor, 1.2),
      largeTouchTargets: true,
      animationSpeed: math.min(parentSettings.animationSpeed, 1.0),
    );
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Accessibility Adaptation
- **Context-Aware Adjustments**: Accessibility settings that adapt based on time of day, lighting conditions, or usage patterns
- **Learning Preferences**: System learns and suggests accessibility improvements based on usage patterns
- **Family Coordination**: Accessibility settings that consider multiple family members using the device simultaneously
- **Emergency Overrides**: Quick accessibility mode for urgent situations or when assistance is needed

## Performance Standards

### Loading Performance
- **Initial Load**: App ready within 3 seconds of launch
- **Navigation**: Screen transitions complete within 300ms
- **Data Updates**: Real-time updates appear within 1 second
