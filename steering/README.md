# AI Steering Documents

## Overview

This directory contains a collection of standards and guidelines that define the architectural, stylistic, and philosophical principles of the Staccato project. While these documents are human-readable, they are primarily intended to be used as a reference by AI-powered development tools and team members.

The purpose of these documents is to provide clear, explicit instructions that enable AI to generate code, write documentation, and make architectural decisions that are consistent with the project's established conventions.
